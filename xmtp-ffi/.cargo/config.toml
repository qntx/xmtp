# Cargo configuration for the xmtp-ffi standalone crate.
#
# Cap lint level for all upstream dependency crates to suppress warnings from
# third-party code (e.g. ambiguous_glob_imports in xmtp_db, dead_code in
# xmtp_mls) that cannot be fixed locally. This does NOT affect warnings in
# xmtp-ffi's own source files.
